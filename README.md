# RPIdirector
The idea behind this project is to create a site to manage Raspberry Pi (and other kind of computers) on the demand. Once installed the client on the RPI, every time it boots it will automatically query the action schedulled for the current time.

## Actions
The current set of expected actions is:
- Open a website [in kiosk mode or not], youtube, google sheets
- Play a local video, slide or such
- Connect to a remote machine, via vnc, rdesktop, citrix...
- Run custom made scripts
